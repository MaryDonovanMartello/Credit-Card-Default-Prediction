# Credit Card Default Prediction

**Classification Prediction with Imbalanced Target**

**Summary**

The goal of this project was to design predictive binary classification models to predict whether credit card account holders will default on their payments in the next month.  The models address the imbalance in the target variable.  Gradient Boosting and neural network models are highlighted.  The paper and presentation walk through the data understanding and preparation, different models tested, methodology, evaluation and anticipated follow-up steps to the project.
